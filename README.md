$ cat ~/about.txt
```

I'm a second year computer science student at Trinity College Dublin with a strong interest in software engineering, cloud technologies, and AI/ML. I'm working on building practical skills in Python, Linux, Kubernetes and AWS to develop scalable solutions.

I enjoy collaborating with others and believe teamwork drives innovation. Whether leading a group project or contributing as a team member, I prioritise clear communication and reliability.
